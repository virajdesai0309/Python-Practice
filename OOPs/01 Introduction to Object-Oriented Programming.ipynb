    "\n",
    "## What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects,\" which can contain data in the form of fields (often called attributes) and code in the form of procedures (often called methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features of OOP:\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit (class).\n",
    "2. **Inheritance**: Creating new classes based on existing ones, enabling code reuse.\n",
    "3. **Polymorphism**: Allowing entities to take on more than one form (e.g., method overloading).\n",
    "4. **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only essential features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Procedural vs. Object-Oriented Programming:\n",

    "## Why Chemical Engineers Need OOP?\n",
    "OOP provides a systematic way to model and solve engineering problems. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Process Simulation**: Classes can represent equipment like pumps, compressors, and separators.\n",
    "- **Data Management**: Encapsulation ensures that process data is logically grouped.\n",
    "- **Reusability**: Inheritance allows for creating specialized equipment based on general templates.\n",
    "- **Modular Design**: Abstraction simplifies complex systems into manageable components.\n",

    "   pip3 install notebook\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting Up Jupyter in VS Code:\n",
    "1. **Install VS Code**:\n",
    "   Download and install from [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).\n",
    "2. **Install Python Extension**:\n",
    "   - Open VS Code.\n",
    "   - Go to Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).\n",
    "   - Search for \"Python\" and install it.\n",
    "   - [Python Extension Link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)\n",
    "   - Search for \"Jupter\" and install it.\n",
    "   - [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)\n",
    "3. **Launch Jupyter Notebooks**:\n",
    "   - Open a terminal in VS Code.\n",
    "   - Start Jupyter:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     jupyter notebook\n",
    "     ```\n",
